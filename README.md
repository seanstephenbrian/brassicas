# [brassicaDB](https://brassicadb.up.railway.app/inventory)

**brassicaDB** is a searchable and editable vegetable-themed inventory site created with several back-end technologies, including **express**/**node.js**, **mongoose/mongoDB**, and **pug**.

using mdn's 'local library' express tutorial as my guide, i built out the brassicaDB web app, covering key topics 
such as database access/management, route handling, and the model-view-controller design pattern, as well as recommended approaches for dynamically rendering content using templates, processing user form input, and deploying to production.
